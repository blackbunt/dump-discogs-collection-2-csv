# Dump Discogs Collection 2 File

This Program dumps your Discogs Collection to a Excel File or to a Csv File.
It can create QR-Images of the Release page from a specific Record for fast lookup.
While Running the program, a local Webserver on port: 1224 is created.
I use this to serve the qr folder for Mergefield in Word to automatically add the right qr code images for every release.

 Usage:

 1. You need an API-Key: https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers

 2. Add your username and apikey to the config file

 3. run DumpDiscogs.py
